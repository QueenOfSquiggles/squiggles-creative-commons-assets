# WARNING
**This page is in heavy development. I only pushed it to the live version of the website to make sure the data-driven segments still worked on GitHub versus my own local machine <3**

# Introduction

*If you are familiar with this page, you can [jump to the content](#index)*

> This page is incomplete, [you can help by expanding it <3](#rules-of-entries)

I will do my best to add more resources and categories as time goes on. If you would like to contribute an entry, or if an entry needs changing, feel free to submit a pull request on [the GitHub repository for this archive](https://github.com/QueenOfSquiggles/squiggles-creative-commons-assets)

## Rules Of Entries
There are a few rules that entries must fulfill to be on this list:

1. A majority of the assets available at the end of the link must be CC0
    - [Specific and Human-Readable details on CC0 License](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)
2. No purchases necessary. The assets must be able to be reasonably downloaded without needing to purchase a membership.
    - The ability to donate or contribute to an artist is not itself considered a requirement
3. The website must be reputable.
    - Safe for the average consumer
    - Generally trusted
4. Original Content is preferred, but stolen is not allowed.
    - This should not be a problem if the assets are already listed as CC0, but if they are reposted without modification and the original artist has the art available, the original artist deserves the traffic and opportunity to get support.
