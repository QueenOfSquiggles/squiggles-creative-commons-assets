# Squiggles Creative Commons Assets
![CC0 Badge Icon](./repo-meta-assets/cc0-badge.png)


I do a lot of different creative projects. Oftentimes I prefer to make my own assets when I have the time and energy to do so. This repository is serving two purposes:
    * Provide access to free, CC0 assets for anyone who wants to use any/all of them
    * Provide me with a backup of all assets I've made in the past, saved off of my hard drive so they can't get corrupted, lost, deleted, etc...

# Information About The Assets

I would not consider myself a professional in any regards, but I am always trying to learn something new. As I learn and grow I may be able to make higher quality assets.


# Donate To Support My Endeavors <3

If you feel so inclined, I greatly appreciate [donations on my Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/queenofsquiggles)! Any support helps, even if it's a one-time donation.

If it's something that would be interesting, I may even open up commissions for CC0 assets. This would mean that the assets are commissioned and then they are shared on this repository for anyone to use, else I would charge a higher price for exclusive access. If this is interesting please [let me know!](https://twitter.com/OfSquiggles)
