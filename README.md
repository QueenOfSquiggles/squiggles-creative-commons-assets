# Queen Of Squiggles' Creative Commons Assets
![CC0 Badge Icon](./repo-meta-assets/cc0-badge.png)

I do a lot of different creative projects and oftentimes I prefer to make my own assets. This repository serves two purposes:
    * Provide access to free, CC0 assets for anyone who wants to use any/all of them
    * Provide me with a backup of all assets I've made in the past, saved off of my hard drive so they can't get corrupted, lost, deleted, etc...

# Information About The Assets

I would not consider myself a professional in any regards, but I am always trying to learn something new. As I learn and grow I may be able to make higher quality assets. Feedback on what you like is greatly appeciated!

# Assets Support (Or Rather a Lack-Thereof)

Generally, I will not be providing technical support for the assets in this repository. For most purposes support should not be required as I will try to include common file types that most software can use. This is not to say that I expect difficulties with using these assets, more as a disclaimer that I will not personally be of assistance if an asset is not to your liking.

# Donate To Support My Endeavors <3

If you feel so inclined, I greatly appreciate [donations on my Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/queenofsquiggles)! Any support helps, even if it's a one-time donation.

If it's something that would be interesting, I may even open up commissions for CC0 assets. This would mean that the assets are commissioned and then they are shared on this repository for anyone to use, else I would charge a higher price for exclusive access. If this is interesting please [let me know!](https://twitter.com/OfSquiggles)
