This is a website front-end for my repository of creative commons (CC) assets that I have released.
I'm hoping to find a way to automate entries for assets I add, otherwise I will periodically update the website to reflect assets that I've added. For now I think I will try to make individual posts for different assets and include a download link for relevant file versions
