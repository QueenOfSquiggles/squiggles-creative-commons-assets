## General
**What is the webpage in reference? Please include a link.**


** Have you reviewed the [rules of entries](https://queenofsquiggles.github.io/squiggles-creative-commons-assets/more-resources/#rules-of-entries) **
(Yes / No)


** Have you reviewed the code-base, specifically the "_data/resource_categories" directory? If possible, it is preferred you submit a pull request with the exact changes you desire. GitHub should allow you to create a pull request edit to a single file which should fulfill most needs. The PR will need approval from the repository owner.**

## Additions
** Are you the website owner/admin of the link you are requesting? If not please ask the owner/admin(s) to submit a request themselves. **


## Removals
** Please name the reason you would like the link removed **


** If you are the link owner/admin, was the link submitted without your permission? (This helps me ensure I don't get more unauthorized links submitted to my website by blocking bad actors) **
